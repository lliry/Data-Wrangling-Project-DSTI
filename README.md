Practice SQL in the Microsoft SQL Server
Using the database WideWorldImporters, write a SQL query which reports the consistency between orders and their attached invoices.
The resultset should report for each (CustomerID, CustomerName)
 a. the total number of orders: TotalNBOrders
 b. the number of invoices converted from an order: TotalNBInvoices
 c. the total value of orders: OrdersTotalValue
 d. the total value of invoices: InvoicesTotalValue
 f. the absolute value of the difference between c - d: AbsoluteValueDifference
 
 The resultset must be sorted by highest values of AbsoluteValueDifference, then by smallest to highest values of TotalNBOrders and CustomerName is that order.
 
 Please note that all values in a & b must be identical by definition of the query, as we are observing orders converted into invoices.
We are looking for potential differences between c & d.
BUT, you must find them consistent as the data is clean in WideWorldImporters.
